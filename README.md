# Java Web Dev TechJobs Persistent

Much like [Tech Jobs MVC](https://github.com/jrcharney/java-web-dev-techjobs-mvc), you need to upgrade your Gradle parameters.

This time around there's some SQL and some Hibernate.

## Suggestions for the future:
* [ ] Merge all the TechJobs projects into one project but into different branches.
    * [ ] Console (A1)
    * [ ] OOP (A2)
    * [ ] MVC (A3)
    * [ ] Persistent (A4)
    * [ ] Authentication (Studio 19)
* See if TechJobs can be converted into a Windows/Mac/Linux application or Android App.
    * If Android app, look into Kotlin
    
Hey! You should probably work on Studio 19 at the same time as A4. At least for the first part.

## Notes
* The MySQL password for this project will be `auth` like with the authetication project, unless there is something else that says I should do otherwise.
* I borrowed settins from `code_events` and Studio 19, so everything should work.
* Is it me or did I put my `data` package (home of all those `Repository` interfaces) in the wrong package?
