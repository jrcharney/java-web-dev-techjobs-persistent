# Java Web Dev TechJobs Persistent

Much like [Tech Jobs MVC](https://github.com/jrcharney/java-web-dev-techjobs-mvc), you need to upgrade your Gradle parameters.

This time around there's some SQL and some Hibernate.

## Suggestions for the future:
* [ ] Merge all the TechJobs projects into one project but into different branches.
    * [ ] Console
    * [ ] OOP
    * [ ] MVC
    * [ ] Persistent
* See if TechJobs can be converted into a Windows/Mac/Linux application or Android App.
    * If Android app, look into Kotlin
